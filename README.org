* blofeld

A spin-off from [[https://github.com/cassiel/clojure4node4max][Clojure for Node for Max]], which is a set of example projects which connect Max to ClojureScript via Node. We started the Blofeld project as another example, but it's getting sufficiently complex that it deserves its own repository.

Summary: a push to develop a simple librarian for the Blofeld. The heavy lifting is being done in ClojureScript hosted in Node, with Max there as a host providing MIDI I/O and some on-screen controls. At this point there's no particular reason why we couldn't have gone for a web host instead (or Electron), except for the history of Max demonstrations.
